      <p class="describe">
        I was born in a middle-class family.<br>
        My father was a doctor worked for the military. <br>
        and my mother was a civil engineer.<br>
        They want me to find an office job in military,<br>
        but that's not what I expect my future life will be.<br>
        I always dreamed of seeing the world.

      <p class="describe">
        After I graduated from University,<br>
        I started to find jobs which can earn money in a short time.<br>
        Thus I started to work as a sales man.<br>
        I did really well in the marketing field and I did earn a lot.<br>
        So I started my immigration plan,<br>
        I moved to Canada</p>

      <p class="describe">
        I didn't know it was so hard for foreign workers<br>
        to find jobs related to their previous experiences.<br>
        I have to change my career. <br>
        I heard that been a cook is the easiest way to achieve my plan.<br>
        So I was in Food industry for about 5 years,<br>
        but I was not very interested in that.
